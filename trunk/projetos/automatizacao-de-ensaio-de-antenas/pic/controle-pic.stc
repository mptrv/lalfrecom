#     gpsim -s mycode.cod -c netlist.stc

# If you want to add commands, you can create another .stc file
# and load this file from it. Something like this:
# ----------- myproject.stc ---------------
# load s mycode.cod
# frequency 12000000
# load c netlist.stc
# -----------------------------------------
# You can then just load this new file:
#     gpsim -c myproject.stc
# and use netlist.stc whenever you save from the breadboard.
